# LongStepCertificates
Certificates proving the convergence rates claimed in Table 1 of the (forthcoming) paper "Provably Faster Gradient Descent via Long Steps" by Benjamin Grimmer. The Mathematica notebooks include everything in rational form and computations (exact arithmetic) verifying all of the need (spectral) properties of the certificates.
